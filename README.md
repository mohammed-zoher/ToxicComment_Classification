# ToxicComment-Classification
Online discussion forums and social media platforms have grown in popularity over the past few years. These platforms facilitate knowledge sharing, assist people in finding answers to personal and educational questions and allow them to freely express their opinions, feelings, and sentiments. The problem is that rude, insensitive, or toxic comments can occasionally creep into such discussion forums. The purpose of this project is to provide an end-to-end approach for classifying toxic comments using deep learning algorithms. Accurately predicting toxic comments can help safeguard online communities and facilitate productive discussions. 

# Objective
Use novel deep learning approaches for NLP tasks to classify toxic online comments and deploy the best model to replicate real production environment.
